## @file
## Jekyll configuration
##
## We try to push as much sitewide config as possible into this file, so a new deployment can start with just editing
## this file.
##
## If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:
## https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/markdown-yaml-cheat-sheet/#yaml
## https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/
##
## Throughout this file, you'll see two # marks at the start of a line for a permanent comment, and a single # for
## configuration options that can be enabled by removing the #.
##
## When adding new sections, be sure to name them so they make sense to others, and to document with good comments
## wherever possible/practical.

## Technical site info
#baseurl: "" # This is better empty
#subpath: "/resume" # Could be a subsite of a domain at a path, ex. "/sub-site"
title: "Brad Czerniak"

## The <html> tag has language and language direction. We can make it configurable
html:
  dir: "ltr"
  lang: "en"
  locale: "en_US" # Technically used for open_graph, but we can set it here

## Standard <meta> tags for SEO, etc.
meta:
  description: "Brad Czerniak is a web business problem-solver."
  generator: "[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)"
  image:
    alt: "Site default social image" # It's okay for this to be an empty string if the image is decorative
    src: required/meta-image--default.jpg
  robots: "index,follow"

## Open Graph - the parts not inferred from other site/meta info above
## @see https://ogp.me/
open_graph:
  og_type: website
#  fb_app_id: "XXXXXXXXXX"

## schema.org
## @see https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html
schema:
  type: "CreativeWork" # (default for site, often "CreativeWork")
  publisher:
    type: "Person" # Whether a "Person" or "Organization" is the publisher of the site.

## Twitter cards
## @see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started
twitter:
  card: "summary_large_image"
  creator: "@ao5357"
  site: "@ao5357"

## Woff2 files declared as webfonts in your css, relative to /assets/fonts/
## Placing them here sets them to be preloaded in the head, which reduces request chaining for better performance.
## @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content
woff:
  - "public_sans/public_sans_variable.woff2"
